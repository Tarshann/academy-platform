Hey [First Name],

Thanks for signing up. Here's the guide: **5 Speed Drills Your Athlete Can Do at Home.**

[DOWNLOAD BUTTON → link to PDF]

These are the same foundational drills we use at The Academy in our warmup progression. Your athlete can run through all five in about 15 minutes — no equipment needed, and they work on any surface.

If your athlete is serious about getting faster and more competitive, we'd love to meet them. We offer free assessments where we evaluate your athlete's current speed, agility, and movement quality and recommend a starting point.

## Email 2: Training Philosophy

[First Name],

Most youth training facilities put athletes on rubberized gym floors with perfect lighting and climate control.

We don't.

Our athletes train outdoors — on grass, turf, and real surfaces — because that's where sports are played. The speed and agility your athlete builds on an indoor gym floor doesn't transfer the same way to a game situation on natural ground with sun, wind, and uneven terrain.

It's harder. That's the point.

Training outdoors builds athletes who can perform in real conditions, not just controlled ones. It also builds mental toughness — the ability to compete when things aren't comfortable.

If you're curious about what a session looks like, the easiest way is to come see one. We offer free assessments where we'll evaluate your athlete and show you exactly how we coach.

## Email 3: Parent Testimonial Story
**Subject:** "His confidence on the field is completely different"

One of our Performance Lab parents shared something recently that stuck with us:

> "My son's 40-yard dash dropped from 5.8 to 5.2 in his first 10 weeks. But more than the numbers, his confidence on the field is completely different. He's not hesitating anymore."

That's the real outcome we train for. Speed and strength are measurable — and we measure them every 90 days so families can see the progress. But the confidence that comes from knowing you've put in real work? That shows up in games, tryouts, and how your athlete carries themselves.

We test every athlete on entry, build individualized programming, and retest at 90 days. The numbers tell the story.

We get this question a lot: "Which program should my kid start with?"

Here's the honest answer:

**Skills Lab — $10/session**
Best if your athlete is new to structured training or you want to try us out before committing. Drop-in, no contract. Tue/Thu 6–7 PM.

**Performance Lab — $245/month**
Our flagship. 3 sessions per week, baseline testing, 90-day progress cycles, and individualized coaching. For athletes ready to commit to measurable improvement. Tue/Thu 7:00–8:00 PM + Sun 11 AM–12 PM.

**Private Training — $60/session**
1-on-1 sessions tailored to your athlete's specific goals. Great for tryout prep, position-specific work, or accelerated development. By appointment.

Most families start with Skills Lab or a free assessment, then move into Performance Lab once they see the coaching quality. There's no pressure — we want your athlete in the right program, not just any program.
