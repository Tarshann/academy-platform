## Instagram — Parent Testimonial Post

**Caption:**
"My son tried three other programs before The Academy. This is the first one where he actually wants to go back every week."

That's what structured, age-appropriate coaching does. It builds confidence — not just skills.

## TikTok — Quick Hit (15s script)

Three things your kid gets at Academy summer camp that they won't get anywhere else:

1. Structured drills — not just pickup games
2. Small groups — every athlete gets coached
3. Skills that transfer to every sport — not just basketball
